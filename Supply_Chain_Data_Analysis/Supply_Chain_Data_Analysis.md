#AtliQ Mart – Supply Chain Delivery Performance Dashboard  

## Business Context  
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. Currently, it operates in **Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara**, and plans to expand to Tier-1 cities within 2 years.  

**Problem:** Some key customers did not renew contracts due to **late or incomplete deliveries**.  
**Objective:** Build a dashboard to track **On-Time (OT %)**, **In-Full (IF %)**, and **On-Time In-Full (OTIF %)** daily against customer targets.

## My Role  
As **Peter Pandey (Data Analyst)**, I designed the dashboard to:  
- Measure OT %, IF %, and OTIF %  
- Compare results against targets  
- Provide insights on customer & store-level performance  
- Recommend improvements for expansion readiness

## Tools & Skills  
- **SQL** – Data extraction & transformation  
- **Excel** – Data cleaning & preparation  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation  
- **Analytics** – Service-level KPIs (LIFR, VOFR, OTIF)  

---

## Key Insights  
- **Top performers:** Propel Mart, Rel Fresh, Expression Stores  
- **Low performers:** Coolblue, Elite Mart, Lotus Mart (low LIFR & high delays)  
- Best vs Worst store → **25% service gap**  
- Recommendation: Improve logistics in underperforming stores before expansion
